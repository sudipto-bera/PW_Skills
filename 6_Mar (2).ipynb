We can use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean, median and mode of the age distribution to summarize the central tendency of the data. We can also calculate the standard deviation to describe the variability of the data.\n",

    "        Ex: uppose we want to know the average height of all the people in a city. We can't measure everyone's height, so we take a sample of people and measure their height. We can use inferential statistics to estimate the population mean height based on the sample mean height and the variability of the sample. We can also use inferential statistics to test hypotheses about the population mean height."
